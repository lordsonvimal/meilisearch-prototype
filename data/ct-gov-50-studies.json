          "briefSummary": "RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may bring about complete remission in patients who have chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying sargramostim to see how well it works in treating patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia that is not in complete cytogenetic remission after initial treatment.",
          "detailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\n* Determine the efficacy and safety of sargramostim (GM-CSF) by cytogenetic examination of the bone marrow in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia who are not in complete cytogenetic remission after initial therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving no response receive GM-CSF for an additional 3 months. Patients failing to achieve a partial response or better after the second course of GM-CSF are removed from the study. Patients achieving a partial response after the first or second course of GM-CSF continue to receive GM-CSF for an additional 9 months. Patients are then re-evaluated. Patients achieving a complete cytologic response at 9 months then receive GM-CSF 3 times weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients are followed every 2 weeks.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."

          "detailedDescription": "This research is being done to see if it is safe and feasible to give the investigational drugs, nivolumab (also known as BMS-936558) before surgery to people with newly diagnosed or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). Patients with recurrent disease may have a limited number of sites of metastatic (spread) squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck. Another goal of this study is to learn how nivolumab impacts the immune system's ability to treat the cancer. While nivolumab is approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with metastatic SCCHN with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, the word \"investigational\" in this context means that the study drugs are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of head and neck cancers prior to surgery and thus is still being tested in research studies. However, the FDA is allowing the use of nivolumab in this study.\n\nThis study will have two arms. Cohort (arm) 1 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about 4 weeks before surgical resection (removal) of a newly diagnosed SCCHN. Twelve patients will be enrolled to this arm. Cohort 2 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about 4 weeks before surgical resection (removal) of SCCHN which has recurred and possibly spread to distant sites, but still can be resected with one surgery. Twelve patients will be enrolled to this arm."

In cohort 2 only, previous perioperative chemotherapy or chemoradiation for the management of localized or locally advanced disease permitted.\n* Patients who had prior surgical resection of distant metastasis (metastatectomy) within 3 months of enrollment.\n* Patients who received prior therapy with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti CD137, anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapies, any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways. Any live / attenuated vaccine (eg varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)) during treatment and until 100 days post last dose.\n* Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases\n* Patients with brain metastases must have stable neurologic status following local therapy (surgery or radiation) for at least 2 weeks without the use of steroids or on stable or decreasing dose of \\< 10mg daily prednisone (or equivalent), and must be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with a history of carcinomatous meningitis are not eligible.\n* Patients who have an active concurrent malignancy that is not controlled/cured and could impact life expectancy within the next 3 years. E.g. patients with localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma or treated prostate cancer with no evidence of disease progression may be allowed to enroll after review by the study team.\n* Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, administration of live vaccination in the prior 3 months, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction or new onset angina within six months of enrollment, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Women who are pregnant or nursing.\n* Men with female partners who are not willing to use contraception.\n* Active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\n* Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of randomization. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement steroid doses \\< 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n* Patients Epstein-Barr virus + (EBV+) with nasopharynx carcinoma\n* Patient with HIV are excluded given the unknown risk of interaction with HAART and the unknown benefit of immunotherapy in this population.\n* Participants who have received a live / attenuated vaccine within 30 days of first treatment.",

          "briefSummary": "Permissive hypercapnia increased the survival rate in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who required mechanical ventilation in critical care medicine. This has been explained by its association with ventilator induced lung injury. Since then, a protective lung ventilation strategy has been very important, with a low tidal volume of 4-6 ml/kg. Patients undergoing surgery will inevitably require mechanical ventilation. In particular, patients undergoing one lung ventilation for thoracic surgery may have increased airway pressure and a greater chance of ventilator induced lung injury. Recently, protective lung ventilation has been applied to patients undergoing one ung ventilation during thoracic surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference in the degree of pulmonary oxygenation and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in hypercapnia induced by controlling the respiratory rate with a constant tidal volume."

The two diets will be compared in terms of their ability to resolve both the symptoms and bowel inflammation that characterize this debilitating disease.",
          "detailedDescription": "This study tested whether the SCD is superior to a MSD for managing symptoms and reducing inflammatory markers in patients with CD.\n\nThe study was designed to include 194 patients with CD who have 1) active symptoms defined by a short Crohn's Disease Activity Index (sCDAI) score \\>175. Although the initial plan was to also require that all patients have active inflammation documented by a fecal calprotectin (FCP) concentration \\>250mcg/g or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) \\>7 mg/L or ulceration of the small bowel and/or colon consistent with an SES-CD score \\>4 as documented in routine clinical practice within 4 weeks of screening, a decision was made early in the recruitment period to enroll all patients with CD with sCDAI\\>175 regardless of the results of the tests for inflammatory markers and to perform subgroup analyses of those with and without evidence of inflammation.\n\nEligible participants were randomly assigned to follow one of the diets in a 1:1 ratio. Participants were provided with 3 meals and 2 snacks each day for a period of 6 weeks. The meals and snacks were prepared by the food vendor, Healthy Chef Creations, and were delivered directly to the participant's home once per week. Participants in both groups were also provided with instructions on how to follow the diets on their own. Participants reported their symptoms through an electronic diary and provided stool samples for FCP measurement and blood for CRP measurement at weeks 0, 6 and 12. The primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at week 6. Following week 6, participants were able to pay out of pocket to purchase food from Healthy Chef Creations and/or could attempt to follow their assigned diet completely on their own. At week 12, in addition to the primary and secondary outcomes assessed again"

The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. T-scores are reported. Higher T-scores denote worse outcomes.",

          "briefSummary": "This study will explore the factors that influence screening behaviors of adults diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an inherited condition in which blood vessel defects called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) result in direct connections between arteries and veins. Patients most commonly have small AVMs called telangiectases on the tongue, face, hands, mouth, and throat and the mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. Recurrent nosebleeds are a hallmark of the disease. Large AVMs can also occur in various organs, causing sudden and life-threatening complications.\n\nThe study will examine how patients think and feel about their condition and what actions they take to screen for internal symptoms of the disease.\n\nMen and women 18 years of age and older who have HHT may be eligible for this study. Participants fill out a 30-minute questionnaire, available in print or online, that includes questions about the participant s\n\n* beliefs about HHT\n* actions taken to screen for internal symptoms of HHT\n* experience with HHT\n* current health status, family history and demographic information",
          "detailedDescription": "The proposed study aims to understand the factors that influence screening behaviors of adults with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is a chronic condition, but with early diagnosis followed by adherence to recommended screening guidelines, the major complications of this disorder can be avoided and disability or even death can be prevented. Yet, it has come to the attention of healthcare professionals that the recommended screening is not commonly followed by individuals with HHT, even when the risk of serious complications is known. Nonadherence to screening recommendations is not unique to HHT. It is rather common across chronic conditions, and genetic diseases, such as HHT, are no exception. However, HHT may have an added barrier to screening and treatment adherence in that it is a rare and underdiagnosed condition. Inadequate knowledge of healthcare providers may be a serious barrier to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The Health Belief Model (HBM) can be used to frame this study of HHT screening. The HBM posits that preventive health behaviors will be acted upon if individuals regard themselves as susceptible to the threat, they believe the consequences to be severe, and the perceived benefits outweigh the perceived barriers. In addition to the HBM constructs, this study will also consider the role of illness representations which provide a more personal view of the lived experience of individuals with HHT. A cosss-sectional design will be used to investigate the relationships among the domains of illness representations, HBM constructs (perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, response efficacy, cues to action), and HHT-specific screening guidelines. Participants will be recruited from the HHT Foundation International, Inc., an outline HHT Awareness social group, and HHT Clinics. Participants will be asked to complete either a web-based or a paper survey. The main outcome measure is screening behaviors and intentions to screen for complications associated with HHT."

          "briefSummary": "Since all the follow-up and care of the pregnant during the prenatal period are carried out by the midwives, the care provided by the midwives to the women during the prenatal period plays a key role for the woman to have a comfortable and healthy pregnancy. Midwives should take psychological approaches in order to reduce the negative feelings of women before cesarean section. Considering all these, it is thought that Emotional Freedom Technique, which does not require any invasive intervention, is inexpensive and easy to apply, will contribute to women's feeling better by reducing pre-cesarean anxiety, surgical fear and traumatic birth perception.",
          "detailedDescription": "Although childbirth is a normal physiological event for the female body, it causes stress for the woman and brings with it many risks. Cesarean section, which is one of the birth types; It is a surgical procedure that enables delivery to occur through an incision made on the abdominal wall and uterus of the mother. Although the cesarean rate recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) is 15%, the rate of cesarean section in our country is 52.1% according to the Turkey Demographic and Health Survey.\n\nEvery surgical procedure to be performed, the decision of surgery and the waiting period may cause anxiety in individuals. Anxiety and fear experienced before surgery; It can cause individuals to experience uneasiness, restlessness and dissatisfaction due to the uncertainty they are in. Preoperative pain, fear of death, the thought that the body will be harmed and suffering, fear of losing consciousness and control due to anesthesia, and the uncertainty associated with anesthesia may cause fear of surgery. Anxiety before cesarean section is multifaceted, and it has been reported that the pregnancy process increases anxiety. In studies, it was determined that the anxiety level of mothers before cesarean section was high. The extreme degree of anxiety and fear plays a very important role in the formation of traumatic perception towards birth.\n\nMany methods are used to reduce negative emotions in the prenatal period. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), which is one of these methods, is a method used to resolve emotional blockages in the energy body of the person. EFT aims to reveal all the points where there is a possibility of negative emotion experienced in the past and stuck in a part of the body. By focusing on the emotions that negatively affect the person in EFT, the energy flow is regulated with stimulations often made by touch. When administered to pregnant women, it may contribute to a decrease in post-traumatic stress disorder and to reduce the level of anxiety and fear.\n\nSince all the follow-up and care of the pregnant during the prenatal period are carried out by the midwives, the care provided by the midwives to the women during the prenatal period plays a key role for the woman to have a comfortable and healthy pregnancy. Midwives should take psychological approaches in order to reduce the negative feelings of women before cesarean section. Considering all these, it is thought that EFT, which does not require any invasive intervention, is inexpensive and easy to apply, will contribute to women's feeling better by reducing pre-cesarean anxiety, surgical fear and traumatic birth perception."

To test this hypothesis the investigators propose a primary care, parallel treatment, patient blinded study in which matched groups of asthmatic patients will be treated in accordance either with BTS guidelines or with our treatment algorithm dependent on mannitol challenge result.\n\nPurpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment algorithm based on the measurement of airway hyperresponsiveness to mannitol challenge, a surrogate marker of airway inflammation, in the long term treatment of asthma in comparison to BTS guidelines."

Regularly cycling women without hyperandrogenism will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit on cycle day 5-9 (mid-follicular phase) for a 10 hour frequent sampling study to observe LH, FSH, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. Either oral micronized progesterone suspension or placebo will be administered at 0900 h.

If they remain anemic after 2 sequential months of ferrous gluconate (325 mg bid), they will then be excluded from further participation in the study.\n* Women with a significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected congestive heart failure; known or suspected coronary atherosclerosis; asthma requiring systemic intermittent corticosteroids; etc.) will be excluded.\n* Women with liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin \\> 1.5 times upper limit of normal (confirmed on repeat) will be excluded, with the exception that mild bilirubin elevations will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome.\n* Abnormal sodium or potassium concentrations (confirmed on repeat); bicarbonate concentrations \\<20 or \\>30 (confirmed on repeat)\n* Women with abnormal renal function (i.e., serum creatinine \\> 1.4) will be excluded (confirmed on repeat)\n* Due to the amount of blood being drawn in the study, subjects with body weight \\< 110 pounds will be excluded from the study\n* Being a study of the acute effects of progesterone on the hypothalamic-pituitary unit, subjects must not take hormonal medications (e.g., oral contraceptives) or other medications known to affect the reproductive axis for 60 days prior to the study and during the study.",

Several shared featured have been identified between SSc and another autoimmune disease, the systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) as an interferon-alpha signature, the role of platelets and the polymorphism of OX40 ligand (OX40L). In SLE, OX40L has been shown highly linked to the active form of the disease, was increased by the CD40L of platelets and induced the CD8 cytotoxicity while inhibiting the suppressive functions of regulator T lymphocytes. The third main factor of the SSc physiopathology apart from autoimmunity and fibrosis is the vasculopathy with an important role of endothelial cells (EC). They turned out to be half-professional antigen presenting cells and can modulate the adaptive immunity."

          "briefSummary": "Proximal humeral fractures are common especially in the elderly population. The majority of these fractures are minimally displaced and may be treated non-operatively. There is however a controversy about which fractures that need surgery and randomised trials have not been able to show a clinically important advantage in patient reported outcome measures for those operated. The trend is therefore that also displaced and comminute fractures are treated non-operatively. There is however very little scientific support for how the non-operative treatment should be designed and performed. Therefore this prospective multicenter study is aiming at investigating the benefit of a four week immobilisation orthosis as compared to early range of motion exercises for those patients not assigned for surgery one week after the trauma."

The dose-escalation methods with a modified continual reassessment at the five dose levels (1x10\\^6, 10x10\\^6, 20x10\\^6, 40x10\\^6, 80x10\\^6, cells/kg) will be performed to determine safety and feasibility of allogeneic BM-MSC infusion during pediatric cardiac surgery and the maximum tolerated dose in infants with CHD. In addition to the primary objective of assessing the safety and feasibility of BM-MSC delivery through CPB, our secondary objectives are designed to develop biological signature measures and clinical outcome measures feasible for use in larger efficacy and effectiveness trials with a particular focus on neurodevelopmental outcome and early postoperative course after BM-MSC treatment. We will determine actual magnitude of differences in neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental variables and postoperative inflammatory and pathophysiological variables after BM-MSC delivery in infants with CHD. Enrollment, follow-up, and analysis are planned to occur over 36 months for the treatment and initial follow-up portions of the study. Long-term follow-up until 18 months of age will be subsequently reported."

Reduced levels of NAPEs and NAEs have been found in obese individuals, and increasing plasma NAPE and NAEs levels may be beneficial to obese individuals trying to lose weight or to keep off weight gain after losing weight. We have found that oatmeal has large amounts of NAPEs, and based on previous mouse studies, we hypothesize that a single dose of dietary oatmeal is sufficient to double plasma NAE from baseline, possibly inducing satiety and increasing basal metabolic rate. To test this hypothesis, we will feed volunteers a single weight-based serving of oatmeal while monitoring its effects on serum glucose, NAPE and NAE levels as well as on subjective satiety.",
          "detailedDescription": "N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPEs) and their active metabolites, N-acyl-ethanolamides (NAEs) are lipid satiety factors that are normally biosynthesized in the intestinal tract in response to food intake. Reduced levels of NAPEs and NAEs have been found in obese individuals, so that increasing plasma NAPE and NAEs levels may be beneficial to obese individuals trying to lose weight or to keep off weight gain after losing weight. While NAPEs are endogenously synthesized by mammals in their intestinal tract, many other organisms, including plants, also biosynthesize NAPEs. Recent screening of a wide range of foods by our lab demonstrated that oatmeal (Regular Instant Oatmeal) had very large amounts of NAPEs (0.17 mg NAPE / g dry oatmeal), suggesting that consumption of oatmeal may be a straightforward mechanism for elevating plasma NAPE and NAE levels in obese individuals. Based on our previous mouse studies with synthetic NAPE and with bacteria biosynthesizing NAPE, we hypothesize that a dose of oatmeal sufficient to deliver 0.135 mg NAPE per kg body should be sufficient to double plasma NAE levels from baseline, thereby inducing satiety and increasing basal metabolic rate. For a 100 kg person, 80 grams of dry regular instant oatmeal (2 servings) provides this 0.135 mg / kg dose. (The dose of dry oatmeal per person = (body weight in kg / 100 kg)\\* 80 g dry oatmeal. Thus for 50 kg person, 40 g dry oatmeal (1 serving) provides the required dose.) This amount of dry oatmeal is converted to the test meal by adding sufficient water to overtop oatmeal by about 1 cm (or to consistency desired by volunteer) and then microwaving for \\~3-4 minutes on high. In the initial testing, no additives such as butter, cream, or brown sugar should be used in preparation or serving oatmeal. Water can be consumed ad lib."

Fifty patients (Males and females) with acute Facial Palsy within the first 3 days of onset with age ranged from 15-60 years old. Each patient was submitted to the following clinical evaluation using House and Brackmann 6 facial function scoring system and Synnybrook grading system. Neurophysiological assessment of facial nerve and muscles was done before and after the end of treatment, then after the end of first and second month of treatment. EMG was done for facial muscles of both sides beside measuring facial nerve excitability to determine the excitation threshold by recording the minimum electrical stimulus required to produce visible muscle contraction. A difference greater than 3.5 mA between the affected and unaffected side is considered significant in terms of poor prognosis. Nerve conduction study of facial nerves of both sides using concentric needle electrode. Trigeminal Blink reflex for both sides of the face. Facial functional recovery was defined as \"good\" or \"complete\" using the same criteria used in the 2001 practice guideline. An outcome of grade I or II was considered a good recovery using the House and Brackmann 6 facial function scoring system",

The automatic method allows a fastest measurement of the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI). Thus, it appears important to know whether automatic assessment of ABI is as reliable and reproducible as the manual method.",
          "detailedDescription": "Two methods are mainly used to determine the blood pressure at rest, in a non-invasive way, in order to calculate the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI). The first method, using a manual sphygmomanometer coupled with a Doppler probe, is considered as the reference method. The second method requires at least one automatic sphygmomanometer. Data from the literature show that these two methods are reproducible to assess ABI at rest. Some authors have reported a better reproducibility of measurements with automatic tool. Others consider that the current accuracy of automatic measurement is insufficient to replace the reference method Doppler. Thus, the aime of the present study is to evaluate whether automatic assessment of ABI is as reliable and reproducible as the manual method."

          "briefSummary": "Medical procedures can be a very frightening experience for children. It is known that children who received painful medical procedures can develop a higher sensitivity of pain during their following experiences.\n\nDuring their treatments for malignant diseases, children are exposed to a lot of painful procedures (eg. needle insertion, lumbar punction, myelogram, etc...)\n\nTherefore, medical societies propose the use of interventions like distraction techniques for pain management in complement of pharmacological treatment.\n\nIn addition, the repetitions of painful procedures and ineffective prevention of pain can create care phobia.\n\nWithin this context, immersive and participative virtual reality (VR) could be an innovative distraction technique for pain management among children undergoing medical procedures.\n\nAttention Pain Theory can explain how virtual reality can reduce the perception of pain. Attention is required to feel pain. When the patient is focused on another subject like an immersive virtual environment, his brain is less available to treat information like painful stimulus from care procedures.\n\nThe investigators hypothesis is that VR can reduce procedural-related pain and can decrease fear during the following procedures.\n\nResults of previous studies are varied : some showed a non-significant reduction of patient's procedural pain despite the use of VR, whereas others concluded to a decrease of pain. The question of the benefit of VR for the patients who are exposed to repeated painful procedures remains still unclear, especially with patients who are likely to feel chronic pain or many pain-related exposures.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of virtual reality as a distraction technique for pain management in children and adolescents with onco-hematological diseases, undergoing painful procedures, compared to standard of care.",
          "detailedDescription": "VIRTUOSO is a study that aims to evaluate the impact of using a virtual reality headset to prevent care-induced pain in pediatric oncology. This study plans to include 34 patients. It is a single-center, non-inferiority, controlled, with cross-over study.\n\nEfficiency of VR will be evaluated for each patient across 3 potentially painful care-procedures :\n\nFor the first treatment, the child will benefit usual distraction and pain prevention techniques.\n\nFor the 2nd treatment, the child will use a VR headset as well as pain prevention techniques (excluding oxygen-nitrous oxide mixtures). The child will choose the application he/she wishes to use according to his/her age.\n\nFor the 3rd treatment, the child will choose his/her favorite technique.\n\nThe virtual reality headset is an Occulus Quest headset, composed of 2 integrated earphones. It is adapted to the environment and can be used sitting or standing.\n\nUsual pharmacological techniques for pain prevention will be maintained as per local practice.\n\nAll concomitant treatments are authorized except the use of oxygen-nitrous oxide mixtures.\n\nThe duration of this study is approximately 20 months. Inclusion will be for 10 months, patient follow-up for 6 months. Data analysis will be performed during 4 months.\n\nDuring each treatment, if the child wishes to stop VR, the helmet will be removed and the usual techniques will be offered.\n\nAfter each procedure, a self-assessment of the pain will be done immediately, using VAS.\n\nAt the end of the third treatment, a short questionnaire will be proposed to the child in order to collect the reasons for his choice. Another questionnaire will also be proposed to the parent present during the care.\n\nA qualitative component will explore the social representations of the parents. A range of semi-directive interviews will be conducted with 6 families by a trained professional under the supervision of the methodologist."

These two supplements will contain equal amounts of protein but differ considerably in their amino acid contents. Whey protein is rich in essential amino acids whereas gelatin is rich in proline.\n\nIn obese individuals with METS, the hypotheses are:\n\n* PHWP will augment fat-mass loss and increase lean-mass to fat-mass ration more than PHG.\n* PHWP will improve insulin action more than PHG.\n* PHWP will decrease cardiovascular disease risk more than PHG.",
          "detailedDescription": "The Metabolic Syndrome (METS) is a clinical disorder characterized by the following problems: Obesity, especially located in the waist area, elevated blood fats (lipids), high blood pressure and insulin resistance. The METS affects one third of the adult population in the USA and increases the risks for both diabetes and hardening of the arteries, leading to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe best treatment for improving the symptoms of METS is weight loss. In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that whey protein (WP) supplementation increased weight loss and especially fat-mass loss in obese, insulin resistant women when compared to carbohydrates. We now propose to compare WP to another protein source in patients with the METS during weight loss. In addition, we will use a special preparation called partially hydrolyzed whey protein, which may have specific properties that increase fat mass loss."

Six patients with histologically verified or clinically suspicious sigmoid colon cancer who are planned to undergo curative surgery will be included. Patients will be recruited from the Department of Surgery, Zealand University Hospital after their case has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Standard treatment involves intended curative surgery within two weeks after the diagnosis. The treatment will be performed within a few days and it will be ensured that the experimental treatment will not lead to a significant delay of intended curative surgery.\n\nIf the pilot study finishes without violating any stop rules and without any serious adverse events the second part of the study will be initiated. This will be conducted as a phase 2 study where 24 patients with histologically verified or clinically suspicious sigmoid colon cancer and rectal cancer will be included. Patients will be recruited from the Department of Surgery, Zealand University Hospital after their case has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Standard treatment involves intended curative surgery within two weeks after the diagnosis.

A maximum of 53 subjects at least 18 years old with Small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic, marginal zone lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma; Grades 1, 2 and 3a, would have been enrolled (34 in Stage 1 and 19 in Stage 2). Subjects should have had Rituximab-sensitive disease, defined as a Partial Remission (PR) or Complete Remission (CR) to the last rituximab-containing therapy lasting at least 6 months following completion of therapy or subjects should have relapsed or have had disease progression following response to prior rituximab-based therapy a Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 1 or 2. During the induction phase, ofatumumab 1000 mg IV on day 1 of each cycle (cycles 1-6) were followed by Bendamustine 90 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2 of each cycle (cycles 1-6).During the maintenance phase, subjects with a PR or CR after the induction phase received ofatumumab 1000 mg IV every 2 months for 2 years."

The dose will be assessed once every two or four weeks.\n\n   Subjects' medication status, uncomfortable symptoms, concomitant medication or non-drug therapy were recorded daily.\n\n   (2)49 weeks\\~96 weeks： Subjects who have completed 48 weeks of treatment may continue dosing at the original dose until the end of the study or withdraw early if they do not experience intolerable toxicity associated with CN128 tablets and have fair efficacy (≥20% elevation on MRI T2\\*) and if, in the judgment of the investigator, the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n   Subjects who have completed 48 weeks of treatment, who have not experienced intolerable toxicity associated with CN128 tablets, but who have been assessed by the investigator as having poor efficacy (\\<20% elevation of MRI T2\\*) and in the judgment of the investigator the benefit outweighs the risk, may, with the subject's consent, have the dosage increased at the additional visit or the established most recent visit to 15 mg/kg in the morning and 20 mg/kg in the evening, with an assessment made at 2 weeks of dosing：\n\n   If no relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the dose may continue to be increased to 20 mg/kg bid and assessed after 2 weeks of dosing:\n   1. If no relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the 20 mg/kg bid dose may be administered until the end of the study or early withdrawal (daily dose 40 mg/kg/d);\n   2. If relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the dose may be reduced to 15 mg/kg in the morning and 20 mg/kg bid in the evening until the end of the study or early withdrawal (daily dose 35 mg/kg/d).\n\n   If relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the dose may be reduced to 15 mg/kg bid until the end of the study or early withdrawal (daily dose 30 mg/kg/d).\n3.

Usage:\n\n   All subjects will be given the lower (10 mg/kg bw, bid) or higher dose (15 mg/kg bw, bid) for 24 or 48 weeks, according to the administration plan.\n\n   All subjects will be given the lower (15 mg/kg bw, bid) or higher dose (20 mg/kg bw, bid) for 49 or 96 weeks, according to the administration plan.\n6. Safety assessments:\n\n   Safety evaluations include adverse events, adverse reactions, severe adverse events, and severe adverse reactions; growth (weight, height); total and free testosterone in men, follicle-generating hormone and luteinizing hormone in women; vital signs and electrocardiogram; hearing, laboratory tests (blood routine analytes, blood biochemistry, coagulation function, thyroid and para-thyroid function, urine routine analytes.), urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing age),Levels of drug exposure during the study.\n7. Efficacy assessments:\n\n   Efficacy evaluations include serum ferritin, liver iron content (MRI R2) and cardiac iron content (MRI T2\\*).\n8. Statistics:\n\n   * Subject characteristic distribution Demographic characteristics, general conditions, and baseline conditions (pre-treatment) of enrolled subjects were analyzed.The measurement data are described by means, standard deviation, minimum value and maximum value, while the qualitative data list frequency and percentage.\n   * Safety analysis Descriptive statistical analysis was used for safety endpoints. Summarize the incidence of adverse events, adverse reactions, adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial, adverse events leading to death, severe adverse events, and severe adverse reactions. The incidence is calculated by subsystem, symptom/sign. Severity of adverse events and adverse reactions: if multiple adverse events occur in the same subject, the most serious one is included in the analysis; if different adverse events occurred in the same subject, the most severe adverse events were counted in the analysis. Drug exposure during the study: describe medication compliance during the study, actual dose, administration adjustments during the study, whether the study was discontinued, and reasons for the suspension.\n   * Effectiveness analysis Mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values were described and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Paired T-test was used to compare each time point with the baseline if necessary. The 95% confidence interval was calculated by using Clopper-Pearson method for the proportion of patients."

          "detailedDescription": "Peptic ulcer disease used to be caused by a bacterial infection (Helicobacter pylori) in the stomach or the use of certain painkillers (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs). However, there has been an increasing trend of peptic ulcer disease with unknown cause (idiopathic ulcer) worldwide since the last decade. Studies in North America found that idiopathic ulcers accounted for 11% and 44% of all peptic ulcers. A meta-analysis of 7 US trials found that 20% of patients with H. pylori-associated ulcers had recurrent ulcers within 6 months, despite successful cure of H. pylori infection and no reported use of NSAIDs. In a pooled analysis of 6 clinical trials with a total of 2900 patients, 27% of duodenal ulcers were not associated with NSAID use or H. pylori infection. The emerging problem of H. pylori-negative idiopathic peptic ulcers is not only limited to western countries. Previously, H. pylori-negative idiopathic peptic ulcers accounted for less than 5% of peptic ulcers in Asia. A recent Korean study reported that the proportion of peptic ulcers not associated with H. pylori infection or NSAID use was over 20%."

The incidence of falls in older adults is high, with approximately 30% of adults over the age of 65 falling at least once per year. Falls can lead to serious consequences such as fractures, hospitalization, and loss of independence. The changes in neurophysiology have also been found to decrease balance control in aging people, leading to postural instability. It is well-known that postural balance is influenced by sensory inputs, including touch, proprioception, vision, and vestibular, as well as motor output such as motor controls. Impairments in these systems contribute to postural instability and an increased risk of falling in the elderly.",

The entire data collection session will take approximately 90 minutes. Data collection will be conducted for both the baseline and the 3-month follow-up.\n\nThe data collection will include:\n\n1. Demographic information such as age, sex, body height, body weight, body mass index, medical history, medical diagnosis, body composition, and the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).\n2. Neurophysiological assessments such as electromyography and Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST).\n3. Functional tests such as the Timed up and go test and Chait stand test."

A brief motivational interview (BI) is a non-confrontational, patient-centered discussion during which the individual's motivation and confidence to change health-related behaviors are explored. Previous studies of BIs in health care settings suggest that BIs administered after hospitalization for alcohol-related injury reduce the likelihood of repeat injury hospitalization and arrest for DUI."

This clinical trial will compare the response of high dose vitamin E supplementation to placebo for treatment of muscular cramps in patients with ALS. We hypothesize that vitamin E will be more effective than placebo in treating cramps.",
          "detailedDescription": "This will be a single centre randomized placebo controlled crossover design trial. Participants will be randomized at study entry to protocol A (vitamin E first) or protocol B (placebo first). The first 2 weeks of the study will be a baseline assessment of the frequency, severity and duration of cramps. Patients will be blinded for the remainder of the duration of the study. For weeks 3-6 of the study, group A will receive vitamin E 800 IU bid and group B will receive placebo. For weeks 7-10 of the study, group A will receive placebo and group B will receive vitamin E. Participants will record cramp frequency and characteristics via a daily journal for the duration of the study, however the data analysis will focus on cramp frequency only during weeks 5-6 and 9-10. Weeks 3-4 and 7-8 will be used as time periods to allow the new drug to come to steady state and allow for washout of the previous drug. Data analysis will focus on the difference in cramp frequency in individual patients in each treatment period."

          "briefSummary": "Identify the association between certain food IgGs (Wheat, rice, broad beans, cow milk, eggs, chicken and beef) and the immunological response in patients with IBD",
          "detailedDescription": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is comprised of two major disorders: ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease have distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics but their pathogenesis remains poorly understood.\n\nIn 2015, an estimated 1.3% of US adults (3 million) reported being diagnosed with IBD (either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis). This was a large increase from 1999 (0.9% or 2 million adults).The incidence and prevalence of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) appear to be lower in Asia and the Middle East , however, in some newly industrialized countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, the incidence of IBD has been rising.\n\nUlcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by relapsing and remitting episodes of inflammation limited to the mucosal layer of the colon. It almost invariably involves the rectum and typically extends in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other portions of the colon.\n\nCrohn disease is characterized by transmural inflammation and by skip lesions. The transmural inflammatory nature of Crohn disease may lead to fibrosis and strictures, and to obstructive clinical presentations that are not typically seen in ulcerative colitis. The transmural inflammation more commonly results in sinus tracts, giving rise to microperforations and fistulae.\n\nFood antigens are thought to trigger an immunologic response resulting in the development of IBD. However, specific pathogenic antigens have not been identified. While studies attempting to associate specific diets with the development of IBD have had inconsistent results, the data suggest that a \"Western\" style diet (processed, fried, and sugary foods) is associated with an increased risk of developing Crohn disease, and possibly ulcerative colitis.\n\nTo date, studies concerning food intolerance in IBD have largely focused on classic food allergies based on IgE mediated antibody responses. The levels of total or food-specific IgEs have been observed to be increased in the sera of IBD patients, and IgE-mediated food allergies are more frequent in IBD patients than in those without IBDs. Nevertheless, reactions mediated by food specific IgGs, featuring a more delayed response following exposure to a particular antigen, are also expected to contribute to adverse reactions in IBD, and food-specific IgGs help physicians identify the candidate food for elimination in IBD patients. Furthermore, IgG-mediated adverse reactions have also been reported to be involved in some cases of food hypersensitivity.\n\nElimination diet can help in the remission of the disease. An elimination diet involves removing a food from the diet for a period of time and seeing whether symptoms resolve during that time. In patients receiving enteral nutrition, it involves introducing one new food at a time to identify foods that precipitate IBD symptoms. Many patients can identify foods that they believe may precipitate or worsen their disease and it is reasonable for them to avoid such foods. Using an elimination diet to identify at-risk foods may decrease the possibility of a \"flare\" of IBD."

The understanding that PD is a syndrome of dopamine (DA) deficiency led to the introduction in the clinical practice of L-dopa, a precursor of DA that crosses the blood brain barrier, and also to the use of selective inhibitors of MAO-B, the major DA metabolising enzyme in humans.\n\nSafinamide is an inhibitor of MAO-B. This study is to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of safinamide in PD patients, that have already completed a previous clinical study with Safinamide. The physical and neurological conditions as well as other safety parameters will get compared from baseline to subsequent visits."

          "briefSummary": "Introduction Pressure Support Ventilation is widely used in patients in the ICU. Matching the patient's respiratory needs with adequate ventilator settings is necessary to ensure a low work of breathing (WOB) and maximal patient comfort. The inspiratory rise time (IRT) determines the time to reach the selected airway pressure. A short IRT results in a high peak inspiratory flow and a short time to reach that peak, but is also associated with the development of turbulent flow, resulting in increased WOB. Aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different IRT settings on WOB and patient comfort during pressure support ventilation.\n\nMethods We will performed a prospective, single blind cohort study in patients on Pressure Support Ventilation. 10 healthy adult patients admitted to the ICU after elective facial or neck surgery will be included. All patients will be ventilated in pressure support mode using a Servo 300 ventilator (Siemens. Elema, Solna, Sweden), with a positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O, pressure support level of 12 cm H2O above PEEP and an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.40. Patients have to be awake and cooperative (Ramsay 2). WOB will be measured with an esophageal balloon, and miniature flowmeter (Bicore system). Breathing comfort will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 1 to 10. WOB and patient comfort will be measured (in random order) at 0, 5, and 10% IRT. For statistical analysis the two-way analysis of variance will used. A p value of \\< 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.",
